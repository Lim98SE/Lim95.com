<h1>L-DOS</h1>
<h1>What is L-DOS?</h1>
<p>L-DOS is my Python text-based shell.</p>
<p>You can run commands, read files, and in the</p>
<p>first version, use a graphical interface.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Lim98SE/L-DOS"><b>Github</b> link for L-DOS 0.1.x</a>
<p></p>
<a href="https://github.com/Lim98SE/L-DOS-2.0"><b>Github</b> link for L-DOS 2.x</a>
<p>L-DOS X is not out yet.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>So what does L-DOS even do? Why should I want it?</h1>
<p>Well, L-DOS can do many things, such as:</p>
<li>Bring up "<i>nostaliga</i>" from the MS-DOS days</li>
<li>Read a ton of file formats as well as play .wav files</li>
<li>Have a GUI <i>(only in L-DOS 0.1.x and L-DOS X)</i></li>
<li>Save some configuration stuff</li>
<li>And maybe some more stuff!</li>
<p>So that's what it can do!</p>
<p></p>
<h1>I downloaded L-DOS, how do I use it?</h1>
<p>L-DOS was written in Python 3.6.2, but it may be backwards compatible with lider versions.</p>
<p>If you do any testing, email me results at <u>lim95.yt@gmail.com</u>. Until then, assume</p>
<p>that L-DOS 0.1.x and 2.0 will only work with anything above 3.6.</p>
<h1>That doesn't answer my question- how do I run L-DOS?</h1>
<p>You can't do it just by running from the conslie, or double-clicking the file. It isn'r a module either.</p>
<p>To run L-DOS, you have to do the following:</p>
<li>Open it in the IDLE editor</li>
<li>Click "run in python shell</li>
<li>Type "boot()" into the prompt</li>
<li>Make sure you're in a directory you can edit in</li>
<li>Enjoy L-DOS</li>
<p></p>
<h1>And introducing...</h1>
<h1>L-DOS 0.1.x DEVELOPER TOOLS!</h1>
<p>This will be coming in 0.1.4, the long-awaited (as in 4 weeks) sequel to L-DOS 0.1.3!</p>
<p>It will released the same day as L-DOS X, which is a mash between the 0.1.x line and the 2.x line.</p>
<p>It'll allow you to actually inject code into the L-DOS .py file or die trying! The reason it hasn't</p>
<p>come out yet is that I would need to override the fact that <i>the file is in use, oh noooo!!!</i> message</p>
<p>that <b>CRASHES L-DOS WHEN IT HAPPENS.</b> I'm not aware of any way for it to <i>not</i> crash, so if you</p>
<p>find one out, please tell me. Anyways, since the "OS" is in Python, the add-ons will be in Python too.</p>
<p><b>IF I CANNOT FIND OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT SO YOU CAN WRITE TO THE FILE, THE ADD-ONS WILL BE SEPERATE FILES.</b></p>
<p>Anyways, have fun with that when it comes out!</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Finally, some info on L-DOS X!</h1>
<h2>FAQ (totally not made up)</h2>
<p>Q: Why is it L-DOS <i>X</i>? Are you getting <i>edgy</i>?</p>
<p>A: No. I'm not getting <i>edgy</i>. It's actually named after macOS X.</p>
<p>Q: Will L-DOS X be compatible with my theme.ldos from 0.1.3?</p>
<p>A: Yes! The Green Box system will allow you to convert <i>theme.ldos</i> to <i>theme.xgui</i>. Or you can</p>
<p>just use <i>theme.ldos</i> directly!</p>
<p>Q: Why is it L-DOS X [roman numeral 10] when there have only been 6 L-DOS versions?</p>
<p>A: Again, named after macOS X.</p>
<p>Q: Why is the site green?</p>
<p>A: What do you mean? It's not green anymore! Update the site!</p>
<p></p>
<h1>That's all the time I've got. Get L-DOS X when it releases!</h1>
